# QLPTool
A tool for packing and extracting files to/from LameGuy64's QLP PlayStation format.

Unlike other tools for this format, it does not use an XML file list and can be compiled on almost any system.
It can also extract files from a pack and save them to disk, which cannot be done with any other tool for the format.
